Nowadays when you hear generative art, the mind goes to generative AI and the controvery around it - but it has not always been this way. JWildfire is a free, open-source fractal flame editor. Fractal flames are those organic, swirling images that look like a cross between a nebula and a bundle of flowers.

You have probably seen them on wallpaper sites and assumed they took hours in Photoshop. They did not. Most were made in JWildfire.

## How it works

Open the app, hit the random flame button, and something beautiful appears. You tweak a few sliders, adjust the colours, and iterate. It feels more like sculpting than programming. There are countless variations which are different mathematical formulas that shape the fractal. Each one produces a completely different aesthetic. You do not need to understand the maths to use them.

## What it can do

Almost every parameter can be animated over time too.

If the interface is still overwhelming there is a dice roll button to generate images with random parameters, and there is always something that looks good that comes from it.

## The catch

It runs on Java, so it is not the fastest thing around - especially without full GPU rendering support. Rendering a high-resolution image on the CPU takes patience.

You can download it from [jwildfire.overwhale.com](https://jwildfire.overwhale.com) and use it however you like.
